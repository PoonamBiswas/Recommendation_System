# Recommendation_System
Book Recommendation System using SVD model.
In this code, we develop a book recommendation system using the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) algorithm, implemented through the Surprise library. The process begins by installing the necessary libraries, including `pandas` for data manipulation and `scikit-surprise` for the recommendation algorithms. We load and preprocess the Book-Crossing dataset, filtering it to include only users with at least 100 ratings and books rated at least 50 times to ensure robust recommendations. The dataset is then converted into a format suitable for the Surprise library and split into training and testing sets.

The SVD algorithm is used to train a model on the training set. SVD is a popular matrix factorization technique in collaborative filtering, which decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors, making it effective for recommendation systems due to its ability to handle large and sparse datasets. After training, the model predicts ratings for the test set, and its accuracy is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

To further evaluate the model, precision and recall metrics are calculated to understand the recommendation quality. Finally, a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's performance in classifying ratings as positive or negative based on a threshold.

While SVD is a powerful technique, other alternatives like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), matrix factorization methods like Alternating Least Squares (ALS), and deep learning-based approaches could also be used for recommendation systems. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on factors like dataset size, sparsity, and specific application requirements.
The dataset used in this project is the Book-Crossing dataset, a comprehensive collection of book ratings. This dataset contains three main files: books, users, and ratings. The books file includes metadata such as titles, authors, and publishers for various books. The users file contains demographic information about the users who provided the ratings, including location and age. The ratings file comprises user-generated ratings for different books, with a rating scale from 1 to 10. For this project, we filtered the dataset to include users who have rated at least 100 books and books that have been rated at least 50 times, ensuring the data is rich enough for meaningful analysis and recommendations. This dataset is publicly available and widely used for research and experimentation in recommendation systems, providing a robust foundation for developing and testing collaborative filtering algorithms.
